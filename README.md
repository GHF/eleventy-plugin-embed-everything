# Embed Everything

This is the monorepo for [Embed Everything](https://gfscott.com/embed-everything), a collection of [Eleventy](https://www.11ty.dev) plugins that allow you to easily embed common media formats in your Markdown using only their URLs.

## ðŸš§ Monorepo migration in progress

As of early 2023, all the plugins in this collection reside in their own repos, which over time has become a maintenance problem. Iâ€™m in the process of migrating them into this monorepo, but that will be an incremental process. It shouldnâ€™t affect how the plugins work for Eleventy users at all.
